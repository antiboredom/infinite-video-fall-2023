## Description

How can code and automation help us see and manipulate large collections of videos in new ways? What do novel approaches in machine learning help make evident? On the flip side, what do these same approaches prevent us from seeing? What do they obscure? How can automated "content generation" be leveraged for political, poetic, and critical ends?

In this experimental video art class students will explore the possibilities (and limitations) of using Python, command line tools, and machine learning models as a means to critically analyze, filter, sort, edit, and compose video.

We will look at historic and contemporary examples of artists and activists working with video archives, with a focus on the political dimensions of experimental filmmaking. Students may bring their own video archives to work with, or use material we collect online. The class will conclude with a public screening of student work.

## Assignments

At the start of the course, you'll select a video corpus that you'd like to work with throughout the ten weeks (you can, of course, change this at any time). Each week we'll cover a new technique for programmatically editing, composing, or analyzing video. The assignments are meant to be short exercises to familiarize yourself with the tools, and to apply them to your corpus of material. Outputs should be short and experimental rather than completely realized works. Every week a few people will share what they've made.


## Schedule

### Week 1: Orientation

- Meet the participants, setting up your computer, intro to the command line (time-permitting)

#### Assignment - Archive (due week 2):

Find a collection of video material to work with. This could be something that you don't currently have access to. It could also be material that you've produced yourself. Share it with the class. Why are you interested in this archive? What does it say or reveal? What does it omit or exclude? If possible, bring a short clip to share in class (no more than 3 minutes) that highlights some of the qualities of the archive that you find interesting.

### Week 2: Basic tools

- Assistant teacher presentations
- The command line, downloading material with yt-dlp, playing video with VLC & MPV, manipulating video with FFmpeg

#### Assignment - Supercut (due week 3):

Create a composition using just FFmpeg. Feel free to use [FFmpeg Explorer](https://ffmpeg.lav.io), or the command line if you prefer. Experiment with running the same FFmpeg command on different source material.

---

### Week 3: Spoken word

- Videogrep, natural language processing

#### Assignment - FFmpeg composition (due week 4):

Create a supercut using Videogrep. Feel free to experiment with natural language processing techniques using spacCy if you'd like.

---

### Week 4: Editing video with code

- Moviepy, vidpy

#### Assignment - Procedural composition (due week 5):

Create a composition using MoviePy or VidPy. Experiment with order, randomness, layout, transitions, and text.

---


### Week 5: Object detection

- Splitting a video into shots, analyzing the content of shots

#### Assignment - Subject composition (due week 6):

Create a composition that selects for particular visual subject matter.

---


### Week 6: Classification

- Using classifiers, training classifiers, zero-shot classifiers

#### Assignment - Classification (due week 7):

Use an existing classifier, or train a new one to identify content in your video material.

---


### Week 7: Camera motion

- Pans, tilts, and zooms

#### Assignment - Final project:

For the rest of the class, you should work on a single project. It's completely up to you what you make.

---

### Week 8: Work time

- Individual meetings

---

### Week 9: Work time

- Small group crits

---

### Week 10: Final presentations

- Share your work!

---

### Week 11: Screening

- We'll conclude with a screening of student work from both sections, data TBD.
